# minesweeper
A basic, console-based implementation of Minesweeper in Java.

Challenge Outline
I have been tasked with the problem of creating a console-based game of my choice, to be developed in a language of my choice. My proposed solution is a console-based version of the classic game "Minesweeper", to be completed using Java as my language of choice. Minesweeper is a classic arcade game where the objective is to clear a minefield without hitting any mines. The game board consists of a grid of cells, some of which contain mines. The player reveals cells, and if a cell containing a mine is revealed, the game is over. If a cell without a mine is revealed, a number is displayed in the cell indicating the number of adjacent cells that contain mines. This information is used to deduce the locations of mines. I chose Minesweeper because it is a game that I was familiar with, having played it a lot in my free-time. Furthermore, I envisioned it to be fairly straight-forward to create a console-based implementation, using 2D arrays to create my own grid.

My plan was to adopt an agile approach to development, by splitting my tasks up into sprints and constantly adapting my requirements for each sprint based upon dynamic feedback. I would begin by splitting up my sprints into the different classes which needed to be developed: Board, Game, Menu, Timer, Main (in this order). With regards to quality assurance, I wrote JUnit tests for each of these classes, to ensure that objective criteria were being met with regards to the functionality of my classes.
