# minesweeper
A basic, console-based implementation of Minesweeper in Java.

Challenge Outline
I have been tasked with the problem of creating a console-based game of my choice, to be developed in a language of my choice. My proposed solution is a console-based version of the classic game "Minesweeper", to be completed using Java as my language of choice. Minesweeper is a classic arcade game where the objective is to clear a minefield without hitting any mines. The game board consists of a grid of cells, some of which contain mines. The player reveals cells, and if a cell containing a mine is revealed, the game is over. If a cell without a mine is revealed, a number is displayed in the cell indicating the number of adjacent cells that contain mines. This information is used to deduce the locations of mines. I chose Minesweeper because it is a game that I was familiar with, having played it a lot in my free-time. Furthermore, I envisioned it to be fairly straight-forward to create a console-based implementation, using 2D arrays to create my own grid.

My plan was to adopt an agile approach to development, by splitting my tasks up into sprints and constantly adapting my requirements for each sprint based upon dynamic feedback. I would begin by splitting up my sprints into the different classes which needed to be developed: Board, Game, Menu, Timer, Main (in this order). With regards to quality assurance, I wrote JUnit tests for each of these classes, to ensure that objective criteria were being met with regards to the functionality of my classes.

Please see below for evidence of the decomposition of the problem into "epic" style tasks:

Each "epic" task is decomposed into one method per sub-task, and these sub-tasks each make up a main task assigned to the creation of a class. My initial object-oriented design ideas included use of Encapsulation and Composition. I've encapsulated my data by ensuring that the fields associated with any class are declared as "private", and only allowing them to be accessed through "getter" and "setter" methods. This prevents these field from being directly-accessed unwantingly. I have also demonstrated Composition through the fact that objects of my Game class have their own Board and Timer, preventing code-duplication amongst other benefits.

Development
I have adopted and used 'good' coding standards throughout my project, for example, I have used Java's naming convention consistently across my classes and methods. My class names (e.g Board, Timer, Game) are all nouns and start with a capital letter, and my method names (e.g newGame, placeMines, revealCell) are all verbs and are formatted in camel case. Further to this, I have ensured proper use of access modifiers by using the "public" and "private" modifiers respectively where appropriate. I have also implemented error handling, written appropriate code comments and ensured variables and methods are named meaningfully.

In phase 1 of development, I started by developing the Board class including defining its properties such as "size", "mine", "board" etc. as well as its behaviours such as "initializeBoard", "placeMines", "calculateSurroundingMines" and more. The responsibility of this class is to handle all of the logic associated with the board which the game is being played on. This includes printing the display board, revealing cells, holding the state of the game, checking the result of a move etc. My code review at this stage mainly involved checking that the board initializes correctly, with the correct size and number of mines. As well as this, I spent a lot of time checking that the revealCell method correctly reveals neighbouring adjacent cells in a recursive manner, until a non-empty cell is reached. One of the changes I made during this phase included the parameterisation of the printBoard() method, to be able to take a char array as input and be able to print both the main board[][] and displayBoard[][] (previously this method only printed the board[][] array).

In phase 2 of development, I worked on developing the Game class. This class is responsible for handling the game logic, including prompting the user for and taking their input, ensuring that input is valid and checking for a win/ending the game. Because the game class is responsible for displaying the in-game menu after each turn, my code reviews consisted of ensuring that the menu is displayed in an aesthetic manner. I also spent a lot of time reviewing and ensuring that input is successfully taken from the user an used correctly. If the user gives an invalid input, they should be informed of this and given the option to re-input. Key changes in this phase also led to the review and re-development of many features in the board class. For example, the paramterisation of the Board class constructor to include an instance of a Game class allowed the endGameMenu() method to be called when the Board class detects that the game is over.

Evaluation
An example of how I have refactored my code can be seen through my implementation of my revealCell method. Initially, this method only revealed the cell specified in its input, however, I refactored this method to eventually also reveal all adjacent empty cells surrounding the specified cell, in a recursive fashion until cells which are not empty are reached. I have also successfully reused my code on numerous occasions, one of which being my initializeBoard method. The initializeBoard method is reused twice in the newGame method to initialize both the board and displayBoard arrays. Examples of how I have avoided code smells in my code include use of the single responsibility principle, where I have ensured that methods such as revealCell() and placeMines() are relatively short and serve a clear, single purpose (avoiding the long method smell).
