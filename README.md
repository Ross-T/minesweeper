# minesweeper
A basic, console-based implementation of Minesweeper in Java.

I have been tasked with the problem of creating a console-based game of my choice, to be developed in a language of my choice. My proposed solution is a console-based version of the classic game "Minesweeper", to be completed using Java as my language of choice. I chose Minesweeper because it is a game that I was familiar with, having played it a lot in my free-time. Furthermore, I envisioned it to be fairly straight-forward to create a console-based implementation, using 2D arrays to create my own grid.
